## Schedule

The class ran as four 2-hour sessions during MIT's Independent Activities Period in January 2022.

## Topics and Activities

The goal of this class was to provide participants with the opportunity to connect sustainable pedagogies with their teaching practices.

Each student was asked to think about a lesson, activity, syllabus, whole course design, or other course product that they would like to workshop during the last session with others in our group.
